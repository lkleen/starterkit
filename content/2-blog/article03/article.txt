## The Beginning

When I initially started as a JAVA-Developer I did hear did read and hear something about J2EE development but I never got a clue what it actually stands for. 

## Kirbytext

Kirby’s content is written Kirbytext by default. It is basically an extended version of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/). In addition to Markdown’s simple syntax, Kirbytext also includes a bunch of useful tags. For example, to link to an email address, you can use Kirby’s `email` tag:

<!-- For the following example, left and right parenthesis have been replaced by their HTML entities, so the tag will not get parsed in this article. -->

<pre><code>&#40;email: hello@example.com&#41;</code></pre>

It is not only handier than typing “`<a href="mailto: …`”, but also encodes every character of the provided email address as an HTML entity to make the life of spambots a little harder. You can also define your own Kirbytags and even override the behavior of Kirby’s built-in tags. Your custom tags will be stored within `/site/tags`.
