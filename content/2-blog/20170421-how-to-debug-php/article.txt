While setting up this website initially I was in the need of a debugger 
which allows to set breakpooints and inspect values at runtime.

# Motivation

My contact form of my kirby CMS did not work as intended. When pressing the send button
the following error message appeared.

So lets have a look to the $send variable

Well, the missing error method evaluates the $send variable
to check if is has been send. But I really don't want to read this mess.

# Solution

Use an IDE with debugging capabilities. 

In the following examples the php project to debug is loacted in 

```
/Users/<user>/workspace/<project_name>
```

## Prequisity: webserver with debugging support
### Xampp (win)
Install xampp and follow the instructions at: https://gist.github.com/odan/1abe76d373a9cbb15bed
Make sure there is no error message in the apache error.log. There is no other warning if it fails to load.
(note: when using php 7.0 the line with the zend_extension must be adapted to  php_xdebug-2.4.0-7.0-vc14.dll

or

download and extract (bundle.zip) to c:\xampp

## Eclipse PDT (free)

download and run 
https://eclipse.org/pdt/#download

set the workspace location to 
```
/Users/<user>/workspace/
```

### Setup PHP project
file -> new -> PHP project
- 'Create new project in workaspace' project name: <project_name> (it must match your project folder name)
- finish
