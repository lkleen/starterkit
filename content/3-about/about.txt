Title: About Me

----

Intro: 

I'm working as a Software Engineer with experience in different areas, ranging from Software development to setting up continuous integration environments. My initial idea to become a software developer dates back to the end of the 90s when I was working in IT-support.  I was often faced with the task to install - not to select - software and drivers of awkward quality on an operating systems which where far beyond the stability of modern operating systems today. 

Friendly customers just let me fix it if a driver installation screwed up their system, sometimes I had to take the blame for pressing the install button in the wrong way. That was the time when the idea grew up to take over control and become a Software developer to create high quality software on my own.
